# Local Development Setup Guide

This guide will help you run the Web Media Design website locally for development and testing.

## The Problem (Why You Saw a White Screen)

Previously, running `npm run dev` only started the **frontend** (Vite dev server on port 3000), but the application also requires a **backend server** (Express on port 3001) to handle API requests like form submissions.

Without the backend running, the Vite proxy couldn't forward API requests, which could cause issues.

## The Solution

The project now includes:
1. ‚úÖ Environment files for local development (`.env` files)
2. ‚úÖ Automated script to run both frontend AND backend servers together
3. ‚úÖ Server dependencies installed and ready

---

## Quick Start (New Method)

### First Time Setup

If you haven't already, run this once to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This installs dependencies for both the frontend and backend server.

### Running the Development Server

Now you can start both servers with a single command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- üé® Start the frontend (Vite) on `http://localhost:3000`
- ‚öôÔ∏è Start the backend API server on `http://localhost:3001`
- üìä Display color-coded logs from both servers

The website will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Stopping the Servers

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop both servers.

---

## Alternative Method (Manual)

If you prefer to run the servers separately:

### Terminal 1 - Frontend
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

### Terminal 2 - Backend
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

---

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend Environment (`.env`)

Located in the root directory. Already configured for local development:

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

This tells the frontend to make API requests to `/api`, which Vite proxies to `http://localhost:3001`.

### Backend Environment (`server/.env`)

Located in the `server/` directory. Contains SMTP configuration for sending emails.

**Important:** If you want to test email functionality (like form submissions), you need to add your SMTP credentials to `server/.env`:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.eu
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=contact@webmediadesign.ro
SMTP_PASS=your_actual_password_here
SMTP_FROM=Web Media Design <contact@webmediadesign.ro>
```

**Don't have SMTP credentials?** No problem! The website will still work for development. Form submissions will fail gracefully, but you can test all other functionality.

### Testing Email Functionality (Optional)

If you want to test emails without using production credentials, you can use:

1. **Ethereal Email** (fake SMTP for testing): https://ethereal.email
2. **Mailtrap** (email testing tool): https://mailtrap.io
3. **Gmail** with an App Password (requires 2FA)

Just update the `server/.env` file with the appropriate SMTP settings.

## NPM Scripts Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Run both frontend and backend together (recommended) |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Run only the frontend (Vite dev server) |
| `npm run dev:server` | Run only the backend API server |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend for production |
| `npm run server:install` | Install server dependencies only |
| `npm run setup` | Install all dependencies (frontend + backend) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see an error like "Port 3000 is already in use":

```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

### SMTP Errors in Console

If you see SMTP-related errors, it means the backend can't connect to the email server. This is normal if you haven't configured SMTP credentials yet. The website will still work for development.

To fix: Add valid SMTP credentials to `server/.env`.

### White Screen Still Appears

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Try hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. **Check browser console** for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. **Verify both servers are running** - you should see logs from both "frontend" and "server"

### Dependencies Issues

If you run into dependency issues:

```bash
# Clean install everything
rm -rf node_modules server/node_modules package-lock.json server/package-lock.json
npm run setup
```

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
The frontend supports hot module replacement (HMR). Changes to React components will update instantly without refreshing the page.

### Backend Changes
The backend uses `--watch` mode, so it will automatically restart when you modify `server/index.js` or other backend files.

### API Testing
You can test the backend API directly:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Test form submission (requires backend to be running)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/submit-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","phone":"+40123456789","company":"Test Co","budget":"5000","projectType":"web-design","timeline":"1-3","description":"Test project"}'
```

## What Changed?

### Files Added/Modified:
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Frontend environment variables for development
- ‚úÖ `server/.env` - Backend environment variables for development
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Updated scripts to run both servers concurrently
- ‚úÖ `DEV_SETUP.md` - This guide
- ‚úÖ `concurrently` package installed for running multiple scripts

### Files NOT Changed:
- ‚ùå `.env.production` - Production environment (Hostinger) unchanged
- ‚ùå Source code - No application code was modified
- ‚ùå Vite config - Proxy configuration remains the same

---

## Production Deployment

This setup is for **local development only**. For production deployment to Hostinger:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then upload the `build/` directory contents to Hostinger as described in `HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
