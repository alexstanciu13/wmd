# Production Environment Variables

# ⚠️ NOTE: If deploying to Vercel, you don't need this file!
# Set environment variables directly in Vercel Dashboard instead.

# Only use this if deploying frontend and backend separately:
# Backend API URL - Update this with your deployed backend URL
# Example: https://your-backend.railway.app/api
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url-here/api
